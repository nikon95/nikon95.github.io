Hello, I am Nikos Nikolaidis, **Electrical and Computer Engineer** graduate of the combined Bsc./Msc. curicullum of the [ECE department](https://www.ece.upatras.gr/) of University of Patras, Greece.

My research interests include **Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Text mining** as well as their applications in **Information Retrieval, Social Networks**, **IoT** and **CyberSecurity**.

My Diploma Thesis, superivsed by **prof. John Garofalakis**, was based on creating a system for **Sub-event detection and Automatic Summarization of Twitter Streams** *(to be uploaded on Github soon!)*  and evaluating the comparative application of three different approaches: 

- A generic spike detection algorithm focusing only on the variation of tweet frequency *(used as a baseline)*

- An probabilistic graphical model using a custom mixture model and EM solver [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11280-017-0477-6) [[2]](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N13-1135.pdf)

- A convex optimization approach based on detecting di-gram frequency changes in a Graph-of-Words [[3]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-76941-7_36)

**White paper in English coming soon.**

Besides my techical foci, for the last 5 years as a student I have been very active in the area of **european student-professional organizations** where I volunteered in positions related to  Knowledge Transfer, Human Resources, Training Design and planning Educational activities targeted at EECS students.

Highlighting some key responsibilities, in 2018, I was responsible for the **online training activities** of **over 1000 engineering students across Europe**, as well as part of a pan-European team responsible for a **European Competition on Machine Learning** taking place in 2017, at 16 Universities accross the continent.
